## ✨ Overview

**Tech001** is a modern, high-contrast theme designed for developers, technical writers, and minimalists. It brings the clean, focus-driven aesthetics of Google's latest design systems into Obsidian.

Whether you are writing documentation in the **Deep Dark** mode (inspired by Gemini/AI Studio) or drafting articles in the **Clean Light** mode (inspired by Material 3), Tech001 ensures your content takes center stage.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🎨 Design & UI
*   **Dual Personality:**
    *   🌑 **Dark Mode:** Deep gray backgrounds, pastel syntax highlighting, and "Gemini Blue" accents. Perfect for long writing sessions.
    *   ☀️ **Light Mode:** Clean white surfaces, high-contrast black headers, and Google Blue accents. Professional and crisp.

### 💻 Developer Experience
*   **Smart File Icons:** Automatically replaces generic file icons with **text badges** based on file extensions (e.g., `PY`, `JS`, `CPP`, `HTML`, `JSON`). No more guessing which file is which.
*   **VS Code Style Syntax:** Rich syntax highlighting optimized for readability in both light and dark modes.
*   **Code Block Headers:** Stylish headers for code blocks in Live Preview mode.

### 📝 Typography & Layout
*   **Notion-Style Centering:** Content is centered with a fixed width while the scrollbar stays on the far right edge.
*   **Visual Hierarchy:**
    *   **Headers** are bright/high-contrast.
    *   **Body text** is slightly muted to reduce eye strain.
    *   **Bold text** pops out clearly.
*   **Material Design Icons:** Uses refined Material Design glyphs for standard notes.

## 🔧 Recommended Settings
For the best experience, ensure the following settings are configured:

*   **Appearance > Base color scheme:** Works great in both *Dark* and *Light*.
*   **Files & Links > Show indentation guides:** `Off` (The theme handles indentation cleanly without vertical lines, but you can enable them if you prefer).
*   **Font:** The theme defaults to *Inter / Roboto*. Ensure you have a nice sans-serif font installed. For code it uses "JetBrains Mono" encoded into css, so you don't have to install it.
